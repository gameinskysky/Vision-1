"Performance of visual-inertial monoSLAM approaches, Julian Surber, 2015"


Brief Proposal:

Over the last Decade a series of different approaches for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on visual-inertial measurements have been proposed. Optimal Keyframe-Based Visual-Inertial SLAM (OKVIS) and Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry (ROVIO) turned out to be two promising approaches among others. In the context of the AEROWORKS project one approach should be favored and enhanced to build the base for localization and mapping of a team of aerial vehicles.

The main contribution of this thesis will contain

1) a useful definition of performance measures like accuracy, computational complexity, robustness and limitations

2) the interfacing of a synchronized visual-inertial sensor with the open source versions of OKVIS and ROVIO running on a ros environment.

3) an analysis comparing different approaches like OKVIS and ROVIO according to the performance measures

4) and outline of future work with a suggestion on how to proceed in the AEROWORKS project

and optionally

5) the application of the proposed algorithm on a set of sensors (camera, IMU) that are not hardware time-synchronized.
